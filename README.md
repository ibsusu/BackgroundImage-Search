# BackgroundImage-Search
Searches for background image of a clicked on thingy.  It usually works for slide shows where the javascript crap keeps the pics from being right clicked.

The extension can be found on: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/backgroundimage-search/olemhlpdoebkeehhjgifmemjdafeikld?hl=en

I most likely will only update it when it breaks for me so do as you will.
